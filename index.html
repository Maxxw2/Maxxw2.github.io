            <p> This website only hosts two images that I use for my osu profile.<br>
                That way, I can have sticky links that update every 24 hours. That's all.<br>
                Enjoy!

            <p> I'm currently working on creating another link that will be hosted here<br>
                This link will serve as a stat tracker, displaying the number of S ranks and A ranks,<br> 
                as well as the number of full combos for each star rating (4* through 10*)
